        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>One of the most basic pasta sauces, aglio e olio uses just garlic and olive oil (and maybe a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat). It sounds too simple to be good, but it's among the best.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pound (450g) dried spaghetti</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)</li>
            <li>Minced flat-leaf parsley, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot of salted boiling water, cook spaghetti until just shy of al dente (about 1 minute less than the package directs). Reserve pasta cooking water.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet, combine 6 tablespoons oil and garlic. Add pinch of red pepper flakes, if using. Cook over medium heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes. (Adjust heat as necessary to keep it gently sizzling.)</li>
            <li>Transfer pasta to skillet along with 1/2 cup pasta water, increase heat to high, and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until a creamy, emulsified sauce forms and coats the noodles. Remove from heat, add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and stir well to combine. Mix in parsley, if using, and serve right away.</li>
        </ol>
